# Speedometer Design

This Speedometer design is based on the TradingView Gauge Widget. The same color palette, font, animations, and design were used to create a clone of it. 

## Purpose

This design was initially developed for my Forex Cracker project as an individual component. However, I decided to make it public for others to use and contribute to. 

## Technologies Used

The Speedometer design was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, a custom TrueType font was utilized to enhance the visual aesthetics.
